    Let's break down the sentence and work through it together.
Possible Sentence Structure
The sentence seems to be a combination of two clauses: one stating the presence of bears at the door and the other inquiring about leaving garbage outside. A possible structure could be:
Clause 1 (bears are at the door) + Clause 2 (did you leave the garbage outside?)
Clause 1 might follow a pattern like: [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence]
Clause 2 might follow a pattern like: [Object] + [Action] + [Location] + [Question]
Vocabulary Table
Japanese	|   Romaji	|   English
熊	        |    kuma	 |   bear
ドア        |    doa	 |   door
ゴミ        |    gomi	 |   garbage
外	        |    soto	 |   outside
いる        |    iru	 |   to exist (for living things)
ある        |    aru	 |   to exist (for non-living things)
捨てる	    |    suteru	 |   to throw away/leave

## Clues
For "Bears are at the door," think about how to express existence for living things and how to indicate location.
For "did you leave the garbage outside," consider how to form a question in the past tense and how to express the action of leaving something.
How would you like to proceed? Do you want to try constructing the sentence using these vocabulary words and sentence structure, or would you like more clues?
