    Let's break down the sentence and work through it together.
Possible Sentence Structure
The sentence seems to be a combination of two clauses: one stating the presence of bears at the door and the other inquiring about leaving garbage outside. A possible structure could be:
Clause 1 (bears are at the door) + Clause 2 (did you leave the garbage outside?)
Clause 1 might follow a pattern like: [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence]
Clause 2 might follow a pattern like: [Object] + [Action] + [Location] + [Question]
